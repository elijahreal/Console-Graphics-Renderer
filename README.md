# Console Renderer

Small project I made in 2 days to test my C++ skills, couldn't come up with a better name. In short, it is a very basic way to draw primitive graphics to the C++ console.

## Features
- Setting characters (aka pixels) in the console window
- Drawing rectangles with/without borders or a fill
- Drawing circles
- Writing text
- Anchoring text to the right/left

The code is pretty small and simple, I don't think any documentation should be needed. Additionally, I am still learning C++ so this should not be used for anything serious and is just my attempt to get better at programming
